# UX TODO

## üéØ Target Users
- **Creative introspectors** - Artists & creators seeking self-discovery through their creative patterns, using art as a mirror for consciousness and personal growth. These users create emotional dependency, not just functional utility. They're not using Latent to make things; they're using it to understand who they are. When someone discovers their depression lifting through progressively brighter color palettes in their creations, that's not a tool anymore - it's a companion to their inner life.
- **Creative artists** - Artists who sell work on Dribbble for tokens/NFTs in crypto ecosystem. Requires insanely contextual and personalized media
- **Early-stage consumer founders** (Singapore, SEA, India) - Need rapid content iteration
- **Content creators** - Individual creators & influencers needing daily content

## üìä User Funnel & Key Personas
- **Mallika**: "What should I be marketing to?"
- **Brian Blum**: Keywords targeting strategy
- **Borar, Rishi**: Early-stage founders needing rapid content

### Awareness Generation

#### 1. **Daily Ghibli-style TikToks** (Start Immediately)
Post one 15-30 second animated short daily:
- Monday: "What your coffee order says about your soul" (whimsical animation)
- Tuesday: "The ghost in your notifications" (digital loneliness) 
- Wednesday: "Your inner child's last text to you" (nostalgia)
- Thursday: "The color of your Tuesday at 3pm" (mundane magic)
- Friday: "Your weekend's opening credits" (anticipation)

Each ends with: "Created in 47 seconds on Latent"

**Why this works**: Ghibli aesthetic = instant emotional connection + shareability. You're not selling AI tools, you're selling feelings.

#### 2. **The Mirror Campaign** (Week 2)
Launch after basic analytics are ready:
- Partner with 5 micro-influencers in therapy/self-help space
- Give them free access for 7 days
- Day 8: They post their "Latent Mirror" revealing their unconscious patterns
- Hook: "This AI read my art and told me I was grieving before I knew it myself"

### The Share: "My Latent Mirror"
**Viral hook for creative introspectors - shareable after 2-4 days**

- **Format**: Vertical mobile screenshot (Instagram story-like)
- **Structure**:
  - Black background with "Day 3 on Latent" at top
  - Generated image center (e.g., figure in doorway, half shadow/half light)
  - Pattern reveal: **"doorway"** *You've used this word 7 times since Tuesday*
  - Glass-morphism card showing unconscious patterns:
    - Transitions, thresholds, liminal spaces
    - Actual prompts: "between jobs", "looking for an exit", "new chapter"
  - Bottom insight: *"You're not creating art. You're creating maps of where you're going."*
  - CTA: "See your patterns ‚Üí latent.ai/mirror"
- **Why it spreads**: Names what users couldn't articulate about themselves
- **Hook**: "Within 48 hours, Latent knew me better than I knew myself"
